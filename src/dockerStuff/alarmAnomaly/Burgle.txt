— HEY YOU —
If you found this, congrats. I left a little souvenir in a picture.
You won’t see it by looking — you’ll have to pull it out.

Important: **do not** run the download command from inside the SSH session.
Exit the remote shell and run the SCP command from *your own* computer's terminal / command prompt.

— STEPS (short and sharp) —

1) Exit any SSH session:
   If you’re logged in on the box, type:
      exit
   or press CTRL+D

2) From your local machine (not the remote shell), run this exact command
   — replace `<PORT>` with the port shown on the challenge page
   — replace `(Filename and type)` with how you want to save it (e.g. `Alarm.png`)

   scp -P <PORT> -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null \
   RoboCop@10.177.202.196:/home/RoboCop/Alarm.png ./(Filename and type)

   Example (save as Alarm.png):
   scp -P 2222 -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null \
   RoboCop@10.177.202.196:/home/RoboCop/Alarm.png ./Alarm.png

3) Once the file is on your computer, open this site in your browser:
   https://stylesuxx.github.io/steganography/
   Upload the file you downloaded and follow the site’s steps to extract hidden content.

— HINTS (because I like leaving crumbs) —
• The secret is embedded in the file, not visually obvious. Use the decoder.
• If a passphrase is requested, try blank (press Enter)

— WHAT YOU’LL FIND —
A short code — that’s what flips the alarm back on.

— end of note —
