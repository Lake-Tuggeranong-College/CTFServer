Encryption Types

Symmetric Encryption:
Same key for locking and unlocking data.
Think of a single key for a padlock.

Asymmetric Encryption:
One key to lock (public) and a different key to unlock (private).
Like a mailbox: anyone can drop a letter in, but only you have the key to open it.

Identifying the Type:
You can brute force your way into this by using AI if needed.
