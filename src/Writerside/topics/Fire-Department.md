Websites are built using HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), which serves as the foundation for structuring web content. Similar to other programming languages, HTML allows developers to include comments within their code. These comments act as notes and explanations for the developers, helping them understand the purpose or functionality of specific sections. Importantly, these comments are not visible to users when they view the final website in their browsers.
