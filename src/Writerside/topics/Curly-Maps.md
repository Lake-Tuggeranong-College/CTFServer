How the Terminal Works

Command Input:
You type commands directly into the terminal.
Commands are specific instructions that the operating system executes.

Executing Commands:
When you press Enter, the terminal processes the command and sends it to the operating system.
The system then performs the requested action, such as listing files, moving files, or running a program.

Output Display:
The terminal displays the output of the command, which could be text, error messages, or status information.

Navigating and Managing Files:
Commands like ls, cd, and mkdir help you navigate and manage files and directories.

ls: Lists files and directories.
cd: Changes the current directory.
mkdir: Creates a new directory.

Running Programs:
You can start programs or scripts by typing their names and hitting Enter.
For example, typing firefox will open the Firefox web browser.

Why Use the Terminal?
Efficiency: Commands can be quicker than using a graphical interface.
Scripting: Automate repetitive tasks using shell scripts.
Control: Provides more control over the system and programs.
