What Is Encryption?
        Encryption transforms data into an unreadable form, making it indecipherable to unauthorized parties.
        The original data is called plaintext, and the encrypted version is known as ciphertext.

How Encryption Works:
        Algorithms: Encryption relies on mathematical models called algorithms. These algorithms encode plaintext into ciphertext.
        Decryption Key: To reverse the process and retrieve the original data, a decryption key (usually a password or string of numbers) is needed.
        Scrambling Data: Encryption algorithms scramble data into an indecipherable format. Only authorized parties with the correct decryption key can unscramble it1.

Historical Examples:
        Ancient Greeks used techniques like the Scytale (a transposition cipher) and the Polybius Square (a grid-based system) to protect messages.
        Both sender and recipient needed to know the encryption scheme and have matching mechanisms1.

Modern encryption builds upon these principles, using complex algorithms and secure keys to safeguard our digital information.
