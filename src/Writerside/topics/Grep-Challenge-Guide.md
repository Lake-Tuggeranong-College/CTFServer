Then, you have to search the file using the "Grep" command. Grep locates the text which you search for through the command and the shows it in the command line. The format for this command is: 

grep "CTF" FindMe.dat

This command works to find the flag because all flags have the "CTF" aspect so it will print any word which includes the letters "CTF".
