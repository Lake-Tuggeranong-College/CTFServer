This challenge involves using an application called Wireshark. Wireshark is a powerful tool that helps you see whatâ€™s happening on a computer network. Think of it like a magnifying glass for network traffic.

When you use Wireshark, you can capture data packets, which are small chunks of data traveling across the network. These packets contain all sorts of information, like emails, web pages, and even video streams. By examining these packets, you can understand how data moves from one place to another.
## Breakdown

Packet Capture: Wireshark listens to a network connection in real-time and captures data packets. It can capture packets from various network interfaces, such as Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and more1.

Decoding and Analysis: Once the packets are captured, Wireshark decodes and analyzes them. It provides detailed information about the protocols, conversations, and network behavior. This includes the source and destination addresses, protocol type, and data payload2.

Filtering: Wireshark allows you to apply filters to narrow down the captured data. You can filter by protocol, IP address, port number, and other criteria to focus on specific traffic1.

Visualization: The tool provides a detailed view of the captured packets, displaying them in a human-readable format. You can see the packet details, including the frame, Ethernet, IP, TCP, and application layer information1.

Troubleshooting and Security: Wireshark is widely used for troubleshooting network issues and analyzing security incidents. It helps identify performance bottlenecks, detect malicious traffic, and understand network behavior2.
